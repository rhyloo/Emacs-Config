* About
This is my personal Emacs configuration, maintained since 2021 (though my journey with Emacs started back in 2013). I treat Emacs as a "Swiss Army knife"—I use it for blogging, programming, and productivity.

* Specifications
This configuration is tailored for and tested on:
- *Build*: Emacs 30.2.5 (compiled with =tree-sitter=).
- *OS*: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS & 24.04 LTS.
- *LSP*: Integrated with =clangd= (C/C++) and =pyls= (Python).
- *Package Management*: Uses =elpaca.el= and =use-package= for a modern, non-blocking startup.
- *Structure*: Employs =no-littering= to separate configuration from persistent data.

* Installation
To install, clone the repository into your =user-emacs-directory=.

#+begin_src bash
# 1. Backup your existing configuration
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak

# 2. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rhyloo/Emacs-Config.git ~/.emacs.d

# 3. Launch Emacs
emacs
#+end_src

* Custom Functions
A brief overview of the custom logic included in this configuration:

- *my/find-emacs-configuration*: Quickly opens the main configuration file.
- *my/reload-emacs-configuration*: Reloads =init.el= to apply changes without restarting.
- *my/get-pwd*: Copies the path of the current buffer or Dired directory to the system clipboard.
- *my/create-temp*: Interactive helper to create temporary files or directories in =/tmp= with path completion.
- *my/find-file*: Opens a file in the background without switching focus.
- *my/enable-line-numbers*: Activates line numbers specifically for GUI sessions and programming modes.
- *my/update-last-modified*: Automatically updates the =#+last_modified:= keyword in Org headers upon saving.
- *my/enable-undo-tree-once*: Delayed activation of =undo-tree-mode= to optimize startup speed.
- *y-or-n-p-with-return*: Allows using the =RET= key as a "Yes" response in confirmation prompts.
- *ar/compile-autoclose*: Intelligent compilation handler: auto-closes the window on success, but scrolls to errors on failure.
- *ar/colorize-compilation-buffer*: Applies ANSI color codes to the compilation output for better readability.
- *ct/create-proper-compilation-window*: Sets up a dedicated, fixed-height window for compilation at the bottom.
- *dired-get-size*: Calculates disk usage of marked files in Dired, supporting both local and remote (SSH) hosts.
- *my-shell-mode-setup-function*: Disables heavy completion on remote TRAMP connections to prevent lag.
- *efs/org-babel-tangle-config*: Automatically "tangles" code blocks from =blog.org= to =blog.el= whenever the file is saved.
